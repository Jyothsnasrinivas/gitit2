Features to implement:

New plan for caching:

/Front Page.page
  file: url-encoded contenttype
  dir:  FORMAT
    file: url-encoded contenttype
/Blah/Foo.jpg
  file: url-encoded contenttype

note - can setFilename even when using sendFile
with exports we'll do that based on page name and format extension.
